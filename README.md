Try it out [here!](https://tbjp.github.io/Babel-Shopping/)

A shopping list translation app for people living in a foreign country. Made using React, Typescript and Material UI.

It uses the Azure translation API to provide translations. As this is a personal project, it is currently quite strictly rate limited.
